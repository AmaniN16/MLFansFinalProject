# MLFansFinalProject
Final project for CIS4930 ML Fans group

The main code used for the project is in the main.py file which generates the predictions for each classifier as well as the
figures that are seen in the final report. The scores for each prediction are generated as well. Some data analysis is seen in the train.ipynb file.
